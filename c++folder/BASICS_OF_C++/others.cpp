/*Constants in C++
Constants are unchangeable; when a constant variable is initialized in a program, its value cannot be changed afterwards

Manipulator
In C++ programming, language manipulators are used in the formatting of output. The two most commonly used manipulators are: "endl" and "setw".

"endl" is used for the next line.
"setw" is used to specify the width of the output.

Operator Precedence & Operator Associativity
Operator precedence helps us to solve an expression. For example, in an expression "int c = a*b+c" the multiplication operator's precedence is 
higher than the precedence of addition operator, so the multiplication between "a & b" first and then addition will be performed.

Operator associativity helps us to solve an expression; when two or more operators have the same precedence, the operator associativity helps us 
to decide that we should solve the expression from "left-to-right" or from "right-to-left".*/

    // cout<<"The value of a was: "<<a<<endl;
    // a = 45; // You will get an error because a is a constant

    // Manipulators in C++
    // int a =3, b=78, c=1233;
    // cout<<"The value of a without setw is: "<<a<<endl;
    // cout<<"The value of b without setw is: "<<b<<endl;

    // cout<<"The value of a is: "<<setw(4)<<a<<endl;
    // cout<<"The value of b is: "<<setw(4)<<b<<endl;
    // cout<<"The value of c is: "<<setw(4)<<c<<endl;
