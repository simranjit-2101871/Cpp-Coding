/*Structures in C++
The structure is a user-defined data type that is available in C++. Structures are used to combine different types of data types, just like an array is used to combine the same type of data types


Unions in C++
Unions are similar to structures but they provide better memory management then structures.  Unions use shared memory so only 1 variable can be used at a time

Enums in C++
Enums are user-defined types which consist of named constants. Enums are used to make the program more readable.*/
